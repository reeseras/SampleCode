# SampleCode
Some sample code to show things I've worked on. Generally I'm not allowed to show the entire project.


# HighlightPlaceList
Used in Unity with Oculus plugins for the Physics lab.
There are a few versions of this code, each attempting a different version of placing. This one was the most used.
